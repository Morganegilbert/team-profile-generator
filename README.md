# Team Profile Generator

## Description:
### The Team Profile Generator generates a set of team profiles in html through prompts activated and commented to through node js.
<br>

### The Prompts asked are:
what is the team manager's name? 
What is the team manager's id?
What is the team manager's email?
What is the team manager's office number?

Then, you are asked if you want to add another member.
Which type of team member would you like to add?

You are then provided two options, engineer or intern. Based on what is chosen, the prompts will change to engineer prompts or intern prompts.

Engineer Prompts:
What is your engineer's name?
What is your engineer's id?
What is your engineer's email?
What is your engineer's GitHub username?

Intern Prompts:
What is your intern's name?
What is your intern's id?
What is your intern's email?
What is your intern's school?

After each section, you are then asked if you would like to add another team member. 
If yes, then you will be provided engineer or intern, which repeats the process.

## Once the prompts are all filled out, an HTML file will be generated into the Dist folder.
